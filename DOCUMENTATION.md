- Run `npm run dev` to start development server at localhost:8080
- Save images to *images* folder
- Edit app component in *app.vue* file
- Edit page components in *pages* folder
  - After adding, removing or renaming pages you have to run `npm run dev` again!

- You need to prepare the publishing in [iTunes Connect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/)
- Run `npm run ios` to create a project file for Xcode, based on [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
- Test your application on several devices, make screenshot on biggest iPhone (you will need them in iTunes Connect later on)
- Create archive of the Xcode project and upload it within Xcode to iTunes Connect
- Send your App in iTunes Connect for review
 
### Backup your application

- Run `npm run backup` to save the Firebase database content to *database-backup.json* file
