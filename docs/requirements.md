# Requirements

> This page is part of the [App Framework Documentation](../DOCUMENTATION.md)

## Required knowledge

Before you start to work with App Framework, you should be familiar with the following documentation.

Essentiell:

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) for command line interface handling
- [Framework7](https://framework7.io/docs/) and [Framework7-Vue](https://framework7.io/vue/) to develop with HTML and JavaScript

Optional:

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) to make your application state-based and reactive
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) to use the reliable backend service provider
- [Cordova/PhoneGap](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/) to use device hardware API plugins

## Required software

Before you start to work with App Framework, you need to install some free available softare.

### Atom

First of all, you need a code editor. We really recommend Atom, which is open source, configurable and available for macOS, Windows and Linux.

1. Download from [Atom.io](https://atom.io/) the right installer for your operating system
2. Install Atom and open it afterwards
3. Select the *Welcome* tab, disable the checkbox *Show welcome guide when opening Atom* and close the tab
4. Select the *Telemetry Consent* tab and decide whether you want to send statistics or not to Atom
5. Open from the top menu *File > Settings* and select in the left menu *Install*
6. Search for package `language-vue-component` and click on *install*
7. Close the settings tab and Atom itself


### Node.js

To run the App Framework scripts and the development server, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), which is available for macOS, Windows and Linux and is free of charge. You can install it with the default settings.

### Xcode

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is optional. You need it, if you want to publish your application to the Apple App Store. You can install Xcode only to macOS machines, like iMac or macBook. You can download Xcode free of charge from the macOS App Store.

### Android Studio

Android Studio is optional. You need it, if you want to publish your application to the Google Play Store. It is available free of charge for macOS, Windows and Linux.

To ensure you install Android Studio and its SDK properly, please read the [official installation guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html).

### GitHub desktop client

The GitHub desktop client is optional. We recommend it as a Git client, because GitHub is great for collaboration or as a backup for your own code. The desktop client is available for macOS and Windows and is free of charge.

1. Create an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/join)
2. Download from [GitHub.com](https://desktop.github.com/) the right installer for your operating system
3. Install the GitHub desktop client and log in with your credentials
4. Configure your user name and a email address under which you will commit to GitHub
5. Close the GitHub desktop client
