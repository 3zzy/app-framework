## App Framework

Before you develop App Framework itself, you should be familiar how to work with App Framework. So, please follow the [end user documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md) first.

## Enable development mode

To inform end users about wrong App Framework usage (forking instead of installing as a module), there is an error message on each script call.

For App Framework development, you have to create an empty file *.enable-dev-mode* in the project folder to suppress this warning.
