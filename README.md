- [Demo App](https://app-framework.scriptpilot.de/) to use as base for your own application with typical use cases

### Design

- Printable templates to design your application with paper and pencil

### Development

- Realize beautiful user interfaces with all well-known components and typical transitions, based on [Framework7](https://framework7.io/), for [iOS](http://framework7.io/kitchen-sink-ios/) and [Material](http://framework7.io/kitchen-sink-material/)
